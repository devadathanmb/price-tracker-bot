}
Rules:
1. For valid product pages:
   - Set "is_trackable" to true
   - Extract "product_name" from the page
   - Extract numeric "price" (remove commas, spaces, and any non-numeric characters except decimal point)
   - Extract "currency" symbol (₹, $, €, etc.)
2. For invalid pages:
   - Set "is_trackable" to false
   - Set all other fields to null
3. Price formatting:
